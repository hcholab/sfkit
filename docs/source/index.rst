The **sfkit CLI** is a collection of command-line interface tools to facilitate privacy preserving and secure genomics analyses with multiple parties. 
It serves as a companion to the `sfkit <https://sfkit.org/>`_ website, by providing a command-line interface for users to run *user-configured* studies utilizing their own compute environments.
